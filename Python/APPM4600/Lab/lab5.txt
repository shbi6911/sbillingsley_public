Method		Input			Iteration	Idea				Required	Pros		Cons

Bisection	f,[a,b],tol	f(a+b/2)	split interval iteratively	root exist	always works	slow

Fixed Point	g,Nmax,tol,x0		g(x)		find fixed point		contractive	higher rate	still slow, might not work

Newton		f,f',Nmax,tol,x0	f(x),f'(x)	use derivative to estimate	differentiable	quadratic	not always work

Secant		f,Nmax,tol,xo		f(x) twice	use secant instead of deriv	contractive	superlinear	follows Newton


Coded hybridRoot function to combine bisection and Newton

hybridRoot worked first try!

Newton alone converged in 26 iterations.

Hybrid required 4 iterations of newton and an unknown number of iterations of bisection

Ran out of time before modifying bisection code to output iteration count.
