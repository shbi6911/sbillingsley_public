Prelab Questions:

Bisection method finds a root of a function within an interval by cutting the interval in
half, looking for which half has the root, and then applying the method iteratively to the
new halved interval.  Assuming a root exists in the original interval, this method will
converge to it eventually.

For the method to work, a root (f(x) = 0) must exist within the specified interval.

The fixed point iteration method is attempting to converge to a point on a function
such that f(x) = x.  Not all functions have such a point, and even when they do, convergence
is not guaranteed.

Exercises 1:	f(x) = x^2(x-1)
for interval [0.5,2] the function finds a root at 0.9999999...

for interval [-1,0.5] the function returns astar = -1 and ier = -1, indicating it did not find
a root in the interval.  The graph of the function indicates that x=0 is a root, but bisection
cannot find it.

for interval [-1,2] the function finds the same root at 0.9999999....

The graph indicates a root of the function at 0, but the function does not change sign.  f(x)
only touches the x-axis at x=0 and does not cross it, so bisection cannot find this root.

Exercises 2:	
First function, bisection finds root at 1, as expected from the (x-1) term

Second function finds no root, expected from the function graph b/c root at 1 does not cross x-axis

Third function finds exact root at 0, as expected

Fourth function finds no root, as expected (sin x has no crossing of x-axis in this interval)

Exercises 3:
7^(1/5) = 1.475773

Python began throwing overflow errors because iterating these functions results in very large numbers

Don't have time to fix it right now, will come back later
