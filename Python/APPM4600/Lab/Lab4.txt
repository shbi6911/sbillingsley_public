Section 2:
Altered fixed point code to output vector of iterations

Algorithm to determine the order:

Run fixed point algorithm and see if it converges
look at limit equation
take log of both sides, rearrange, substitute, get equation for alpha in terms of p_(n+1), p_(n-1), and pn
compute carefully with iterated values, find alpha, and then find lambda if necessary

2a)	converges to given fixed point, accurate to 10 digits (1.3652300134) in 12 iterations
2b)	algorithm indicates linear convergence alpha=1
	fails on some values because of cancellation due to points being close to the fixed point
	found lambda = 1.0000423337013937

This is all I got through.
