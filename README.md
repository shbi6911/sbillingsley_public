Code and documents written by Shane Billingsley, provided to demonstrate capability

Most code written for Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering Sciences at University of Colorado Boulder

Most relevant samples provided in Portfolio folder
	-ASEN1320_FinalProject is MATLAB and C++ code written for a freshman-year, introductory computing course
	It involved integrating an orbit, calculating visibility to a ground station, and animating the result

	-ASTR2600_FinalProject is a Python Jupyter notebook written as a final project for an elective class.  It
	is an n-body integration using a simple custom integrator function, which produces an animation of the
	resulting n-body simulation

	-ASEN5050_Functions are MATLAB functions written in ASEN 5050 Space Flight Dynamics, an astrodynamics class
	focused on the two-body problem.  These functions convert between different orbital elements, visualize
	2BP orbits using f and g functions, and solve Kepler's equation to find time along an orbit

	-ASEN6060_Projects are MATLAB scripts written for ASEN 6060 Advanced Astrodynamics, focused on the circular
	restricted three-body problem.  This class incorporates five homeworks and a final project as the sum total
	of the class grade, so each script performs a number of task, documented within the script.
